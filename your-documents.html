                    </p>
                    <p class="dguidetext_design">Guidance Note:Section 3</p>
                    <p class="dguidetext_design">We understand that this wording can be confusing and that you might be worried about how much you will have to pay if you win.</p>
                    <p class="dguidetext_design">Legally, we must word our CFA in a specific way, but if your claim is successful, the only thing you will pay is our success fee. We will recover all the other costs, charges and expenses (including insurance premiums) that you are liable for from the Defendant or the insurance provider.</p>
                    <p class="dguidetext_design">Any success fee deducted from your compensation will be capped at 25% and we guarantee that you will receive no less than 75% of any compensation awarded to you as long as you abide by our T&Cs.*</p>

                    <p>
                    	<strong>4.1</strong> If you receive interim damages before the end of your claim, we may require you to pay our disbursements and expenses to date at that point and an amount for future expenses and disbursements;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>4.2</strong> If your claim is successful but you are ordered to pay the other side’s charges following an Interlocutory Hearing, then such charges will usually only be up to the amount of damages awarded to you. Such charges may be covered by your ATE insurance policy subject to the terms of the policy and your compliance with such terms;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>4.3</strong> If, prior to a final Judgment, you are awarded any costs, either by way of a Court Order or Agreement, then we are entitled to payment of those costs together with any success fee on those charges if your claim is successful.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mt-3">5. What Do I Pay If I Lose?</h3>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>5.1</strong> If you lose you do not have to pay our basic charges provided that you have complied with our Terms and Conditions. However, you may be required to pay our disbursements and expenses, although these may be covered by any ATE insurance policy you have purchased, subject to compliance with the Terms and Conditions of that policy;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>5.2</strong> If you lose your claim, you may be responsible for some, or all, of the Opponent’s costs. If your claim includes a claim for General Damages for Pain, Suffering and Loss of Amenity, then you may benefit from Qualified One-Way Costs Shifting. In such circumstances, the Court will not usually enforce an Order for Costs against you unless:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>5.2.1</strong> The claim is fundamentally dishonest; or
                    </p>

                    <p class="dguidetext_design">However, we take out insurance to protect you from these costs, and, as long as you agree to this insurance and abide by our T&Cs* you won’t have to pay a penny.</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-3">6. Basic Charges</h3>
                    <p>

Any other type of letters and telephone calls will be charged on a time engaged basis.

This section should be read alongside our Terms and Conditions and the section entitled ‘Your Legal Costs and Disbursements’.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>6.3</strong> The hourly rate set out in 6.2 assumes that the work being undertaken relates to negotiations and/or proceedings in the County Court that is commensurate with the type of work, in terms of value and complexity akin to that jurisdiction. Occasionally it may be necessary to commence proceedings in the High Court in relation to declaration proceedings or proceedings for Injunctive relief. In these circumstances, and to reflect the increase complexity of these types of proceedings our hourly rate will be charged at £550 per hour.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="mt-3">Right to Cancel/Ending This Agreement</h3>

However, if you end the Agreement before you ‘Win’ or ‘Lose’, you pay our basic charges and disbursements and expenses. If your case ultimately succeeds, you also pay a success fee.

                    <h3 class="mt-3">8. The Success Fee</h3>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>8.1</strong> The success fee is set at 75% of our basic charges, or 100%, if the claim concludes less than 45 days before Trial, including following a Judgment.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>8.2.3</strong> Any other appropriate factors;

                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>8.2.6</strong> Unless it is expressly stated in writing, no part of the success fee relates to postponement of payment of fees and expenses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>8.2.7</strong> Additional case specific risks which are set out in any risk assessment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>8.3</strong> The success fee cannot be more than 100% of the basic charges in total.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>8.4</strong> As your claim may include a claim for Pain, Suffering and Loss of Amenity, for psychological or psychiatric injury, there is a maximum limit, in percentage terms, on the level of success fee which we can recover from you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>8.5</strong> That maximum limit is 25% of the total amount of any claim for General Damages for Pain, Suffering, Loss of Amenity and Damages for Pecuniary loss. Claims for future Pecuniary Loss are unaffected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>8.6</strong> The maximum limit in percentage terms that is applicable is net of any sums recoverable by the Compensation Recovery Unit of the Department of Work and Pensions. The maximum limit (25%) is inclusive of any VAT charges at the prevailing rate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>8.7</strong> The maximum limit, in percentage terms, only applies to a success fee for proceedings at first instance. The maximum limit would not apply, for example, to any Appeal by your opponent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>8.8</strong> In the event of a dispute regarding the calculation of the success fee, the parties agree for the dispute to be determined by an independent barrister of at least 10 years call, to be appointed by agreement between us. In default of agreement, the barrister be appointed by the President of the Law Society of England and Wales, such barrister to act as expert, not arbitrator and his/her decision shall be binding. The barrister’s fees are to be met by the losing party to the dispute.
                    </p>
                    <p class="dguidetext_design">Guidance Note: Section 8</p>
                    <p class="dguidetext_design">We calculate our success fee by taking the costs we have incurred and multiplying them by either 75% (if the case concludes before litigation) or 100% after litigation.</p>
                    <p class="dguidetext_design">If we win, you will be liable for our success fee (if we cannot recover this from the other side). However, we guarantee that you will never have to pay more than 25% of any compensation you receive.</p>
                    <p class="dguidetext_design">We will waive any amount that takes your success fee payment above this 25%. So, you will always receive 75% of any compensation awarded as long as you abide by our T&Cs.*</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-3">9. Additional Information and Terms</h3>
                    <p>
                    	<strong>9.1</strong> We add VAT at the prevailing rate that applies to the work when it has been carried out. VAT is added to the total of the basic charges and the success fee (however, the maximum success fee of 25% is inclusive of VAT).

If this happens, we will not claim our basic charges and success fee for any work done after the expiry of the Part 36 Offer. However, in these circumstances, you may be ordered to pay your opponent’s costs from the expiry of the Part 36 Offer. If your claim includes a claim for General Damages for Pain Suffering and Loss of Amenity, then any payment to your Opponent in costs, will be limited to the amount of damages and interest awarded to you, under the Qualified One-Way Costs Shifting Provisions;
                    </p>
